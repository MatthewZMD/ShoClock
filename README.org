#+TITLE: 2019 MakeUofT: Project ShoClock
Meet ShoClock, your special morning alarm that gives you some bits of goosebumps!
* What is ShoClock
  ShoClock is a special watch that triggers to alarm music through bluetooth connection on your phone, which will cause an very tiny electric shock. This shock will not stop until RFID tag touches the surface. And this RIFD tag can be put anywhere in your preference, on your doorstep, or in the washroom, as a tool to confirm you are fully awake and moved out from your bed.
* Inspiration
  In our daily lives, there are numerous occations where people need to wake up early morning, either going to work or going to school. Although we could try our best to sleep earlier the night before, but sometimes it is very hard. Therefore we made this ShoClock with the hope that it will be useful to someone.
