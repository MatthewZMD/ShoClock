Meet ShoClock, your special morning alarm that gives you some bits of goosebumps!
* Inspiration
  In our daily lives, there are numerous occations where people need to wake up early morning, either going to work or going to school. Although we could try our best to sleep earlier the night before, but sometimes it is very hard. Therefore we made this ShoClock with the hope that it will be useful to someone.
* What it does
  ShoClock is connected to bluetooth on your phone which will trigger to alarm music, which will cause an electric shock within a very safe range. This shock will not stop until RFID component touches the equipment, which can be put anywhere, on your doorstep, or in the washroom. Then it confirms that the user has waken up and get out of the bed.
